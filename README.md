# data-uploader

A web-based uploader to transfer information and data via a form. Utilizes various validation techniques to check for discrepancies.

I built this tool for use at my work for transferring data across study sites. It was necessary to streamline the data uploads with consistent naming conventions. The form is used to populate expected filenames. If the data and form passes all of the checks, then the data is transferred to the proper folder on the web server.

The code can easily be tailored for other uses. I have altered/hidden some of the code to preserve security for my live project.
